Please do fork this project and issue Pull Requests. There are two caveats though:

First, there are some philosophic goals at play here, mainly around making
computer encryption software easy to use, which is deceptively difficult. I
don't like rejecting Pull Requests, but additions that run counter to those
goals won't be accepted. If you're not sure, add an issue before starting work.

Second, as part of the above, this project is in the public domain. I retain no
rights to how it's used. Your Pull Request constitutes your good faith
contribution of the work therein into the public domain as well. I don't think
that will really be a problem for most people, but you should know that going
in.

        <p>There are scads of options presented by GnuPG, which are all part of
making it the flexible and powerful an encryption framework that it
is. But it's extremely complicated to get started with, and that quite
reasonably puts people off.</p>

<p><strong>egpg</strong> is a wrapper script that tries to simplify the process of
using GnuPG. In order to simplify things, it is opinionated about the
"right" way to use GnuPG.</p>

<p>The philosophic goals here are these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make GPG as easy to use as possible. The more people using strong
encryption, the better for everyone. One of the big hang ups right
now is that the GPG tools are difficult to use - moreso than they
strictly have to be.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the interface itself auditable. This is why this is presented
as shell scripts rather than a web service or a GUI. If you're
concerned about what <strong>egpg</strong> does, open up the files and read
them, or have someone you trust read them.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a guide forward. The simplified interface provided here
should be good to get started with, and with luck many users will
find they never need anything beyond what <strong>egpg</strong> provides. If you
find that you need to do something more, though, the goal is that
you have a foundation to start with, and some direction on how to
proceed.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You'll need <code>gpg2</code> installed. Most Linux distros have some variant
of</p>

<p><code>apt-get install gnupg</code></p>

<p>Mac OS X users with <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> installed can do</p>

<p><code>brew install gnupg2</code></p>

<p>Or else install the full <a href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPGTools</a> suite.</p>

<p>Whatever package you install will need to include <code>gpg</code> and
<code>gpgconf</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You'll also need <a href="http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/">haveged</a> which will improve greatly the speed
of generating new gpg keys. In Debian based distros it can be
installed with:</p>

<p><code>apt-get install haveged</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also nice to have <a href="https://gaffer.ptitcanardnoir.org/intrigeri/code/parcimonie/">parcimonie</a> installed (although not required):</p>

<p><code>apt-get install parcimonie</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage:</h2>

<p>*<em>egpg</em> presents a series of subcommands. At present there are:</p>

<pre><code>./egpg help
./egpg key-gen &lt;email&gt; [&lt;name&gt;]
./egpg fingerprint
./egpg revoke [&lt;revocation-certificate&gt;]
./egpg seal &lt;file&gt; [&lt;recipient&gt;+]
./egpg open &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Those are the day to day "sign-encrypt" and "decrypt-verify"
operations.</p>

<p>Planned are:</p>

<pre><code>./egpg init
./egpg trust &lt;users key&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These should be the minimal set required to use GPG effectively.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or discussions about supported operations, simplified
terminology, etc. is wellcome.</p>
